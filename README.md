# Grimworld

A RimWorld-style colony simulation game set in the decaying suburbs of America, where dark conspiracies, government secrets, and fast food mascots shape the fate of society.

## üß† Overview

Grimworld is a top-down, tile-based simulation and storytelling game inspired by RimWorld, but set in an urban and suburban environment. The tone is darkly satirical and surreal, exploring the intersection of American suburbia, late-stage capitalism, conspiracy theories, and fast food culture.

Players manage a group of survivors in a procedurally generated American suburb cut off from the rest of the world after a mysterious societal collapse. They're surrounded by fast food ruins, cul-de-sacs, strip malls, and abandoned highway exits while uncovering secrets about shadow governments, psychic experiments, and the mascot known only as... Grimace.
